## Personal Linux Config Files

Here are my Personal Config Files wich i use on Manjaro Linux

Feel free to fork and customize it ;)

## Install

Clone it into .config/conf-lnx Directory

```Bash
git clone https://github.com/AemPi/Linux_Configs.git ~/.config/conf-lnx
```

After cloning the Repo cd into the ~.config/conf-lnx directory and execute the 'create_ConfigLinks.sh' Script to link all files to the right Place.
The Script is created for Arch Based Distros with the pacman Packetmanager!
